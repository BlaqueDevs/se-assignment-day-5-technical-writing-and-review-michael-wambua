      Use: "Set up the settings."
      Why: "Set up" is a familiar phrase that clearly conveys the meaning. "Configure" is more technical and less intuitive.
    -Instead of: "Utilize the function."
      Use: "Use the function."
      Why: "Use" is a basic verb that everyone understands. "Utilize" is unnecessarily formal.
    -Instead of: "Deactivate the feature."
      Use: "Turn off the feature."
      Why: "Turn off" is a common phrase that is widely understood. "Deactivate" is more technical.
    -Instead of: "Synchronize the data."
      Use: "Update the data." or "Match the data."
      Why: "Synchronize" is a technical term. "Update" or "match" are simpler and more descriptive.
    3. Describing Technical Concepts:
    -Instead of: "The algorithm iterates."
      Use: "The system repeats the steps."
      Why: "Iterates" is a technical term specific to programming. "Repeats the steps" is a simpler, more accessible explanation.
    -Instead of: "The data is being parsed."
      Use: "The data is being organized." or "The data is being read."
      Why: "Parsed" is a technical term that may not be familiar to a general audience. "Organized" or "read" are   simpler and more descriptive.
    -Instead of: "The system is in a state of latency."
      Use: "The system is slow." or "There is a delay."
      Why: "Latency" is a technical term. "Slow" or "delay" are far more common and easily understood.
    -Instead of: "The system is undergoing a reboot."
    Use: "The system is restarting."
      Why: "Reboot" is a common technical term, however "restarting" is just as accurate, and is more easily understood by those that are not as technical.
    4. Describing User Interfaces:
    -Instead of: "Navigate to the directory."
      Use: "Go to the folder."
      Why: "Folder" is a more common and user-friendly term than "directory."
    -Instead of: "Input the credentials."
      Use: "Enter your username and password."
      Why: "Credentials" is a formal term. "Username and password" are more direct and understandable.

      -Capitalization: Follow a consistent capitalization style (e.g., title case, sentence case).
    5. Keywords and Searchability:
      -Incorporate Keywords: Include relevant keywords in headings to improve searchability and SEO.
      -Front-Load Keywords: Place important keywords at the beginning of the heading.
    6. Reader-Centric Approach:
      -Anticipate Reader Questions: Headings should answer questions that readers might have about the content.
      -Use Action Verbs: When appropriate, use action verbs to create dynamic and engaging headings.
      -Use Question Headings: For certain types of documents, question headings can be very effective.
    7. Avoid These Common Pitfalls:
      -Avoid Overuse of Headings: Too many headings can make the document feel fragmented.
      -Avoid Ending Headings with Punctuation: Unless it is a question, do not end headings with punctuation.
      -Avoid Redundant Headings: Ensure that each heading provides unique and valuable information.
      -Avoid "Clickbait" Headings: Do not use misleading headings to try and get readers to read your document.
